Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I don't think a particular experience helped me see this, but then the continuous 
knowledge I gained on the topic helped me appreciate and look at programs in smaller bits, which are functions.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions give me the confidence that my function code works fine and it can be resuable. 
Test functions go through my function code and confirm that the program does what it is meant to do. 

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
You need to know what type of error you're dealing with first. You can find this out
by looking at the error message. You can then tackle that problem based on your knowledge 
of resolving the problem.
